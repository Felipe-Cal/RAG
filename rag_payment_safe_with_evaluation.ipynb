    "This RAG system has two phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Offline (batch) phase**\n",
    "   - Load internal payment and risk documents from the `data` folder.\n",
    "   - Split them into chunks, embed them, and build a vector index.\n",
    "   - This runs periodically whenever policies or documentation change.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Online (request-time) phase**\n",
    "   - Receive a question from a payments analyst (for example, why a transaction was high risk).\n",
    "   - Retrieve the most relevant chunks from the index.\n",
    "   - Ask the LLM to answer **using only that retrieved context**.\n",
    "   - Run validation rules and log inputs/outputs for audit and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the notebook walks through these two phases step by step.\n"
